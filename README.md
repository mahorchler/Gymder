# Gymder (Group 5)
Welcome to gymder! This is an application to find gym buddies that attend your gym. It is built using java and android xml and the database and user management system is built using google firebase. <br><br>

# Run the APK
To run the application without having to setup the code in an IDE, run apk file found in the home directory of this repo. This can be done using many android emulators such as Bluestacks or downloading onto an actual android device.
<br><br>
One example we found to run APKs is through this online emulator service: https://www.apkonline.net. To upload here, go to the android emualtor, go to upload apk, and upload the apj file before running. though this can be done through downloading the apk through android studio or simply directly onto an android device. Simply hit the >Run APK button after uplaoding the APK to the service. 

# Setting up the Code in an IDE (Android Studio)
To set up the code in android studio, simply clone or download this repo and enter android studio. Select "import project" and select the downloaded Gymder folder as your project.
