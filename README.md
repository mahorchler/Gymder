# Gymder (Group 5)
Welcome to gymder! This is an application to find gym buddies that attend your gym. It is built using java and android xml and the database and user management system is built using google firebase. <br><br>

# Run the APK
To run the application without having to setup the code in an IDE, run apk file found in the home directory of this repo. This can be done using many android emulators such as Bluestacks or downloading onto an actual android device.
<br><br>
One example we found to run APKs is through this online emulator service: https://www.apkonline.net. To upload here, go to the android emualtor, try online, go to upload apk, and upload the apk file before running. Simply hit the >Run APK button after uploading the APK to the service. 

# Setting up the Code in an IDE (Android Studio)
To set up the code in android studio, simply clone or download this repo and enter android studio. Select "import project" and select the downloaded Gymder folder as your project.

# Parts of the application
<h1>Login</h1>
<br>Here you can register or login to an existing account. If you want some premade logins to test out with, we have arnav@gmail.com maylin@gmail.com ricky@gmail.com and the password to all of those is 123456. Those three logins all have a match so you can test the chat through there. Alternatively you could make multiple accounts and match them manually. 
<br> <h1>Chat</h1><br><br>
In the chat section, you can chat with users. The chat functionality will open between two users once those two users are matched (have both liked each other). These messages update live and can be sent to one another in real time.
<br><br>
<h1>Search</h1><br><br>
In the search section, you can see a list of all users and click on their profiles. From there, you can like or dislike them.
<br><br>
<h1>Profile</h1><br><br>
From the profile section, you can see and edit your own profile as well as log out or delete your account.
